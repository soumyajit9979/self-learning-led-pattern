# self-learning-led-pattern

a mobile app is created, whereyou will becontrolling the leds with you mobile app
you can give what ever pattern you want, after you are done, press a button that sends signal 'F'
this will repeat the entire pattern by itself, meanwhile the bluetooth will get disconnected and it will again turnon after the entire repetation is completed
disadvantage: Arduino does not have that much memmory to store all the values with a rate of 9600 baud, you can hardly give a pattern up to 30-35 secs
